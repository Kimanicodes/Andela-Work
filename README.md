# Andela Bootcamp for Cohort 8 Work,Exercises and assignments.
**Introduction**
The work has been organised in the main repository under the name ***Andela-Work***.

The work is organised in files that I believe are self-explanatory to mean the days at the bootcamp and the corresponding exercises.
Any more information can be gotten in the respective folders.

To view it:
* first clone the repo at [https://github.com/Kimanicodes/Andela-Work/]  
* proceed to view the files from your preferred
text editor.
